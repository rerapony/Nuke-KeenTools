    /*! \class DD::Image::LUT

       A LUT defines a mapping function. One side is the floating point
       numbers used in Nuke. The other side (the side it goes "to" and "from")
       is generally values that are used in a file or by a piece of
       hardware.

       The LUT class can very quickly convert between an array of floating
       point number in Nuke and arrays of 8 bit or 16 bit numbers. It can
       also convert float<->float and may be faster depending on the
       complexity of the function. All this is done by using lookup tables
       and linear interpolation between the table entries. When converting
       to integers, error diffusion is used to hide posterization.

       Any subclass must implement to_byte() and from_byte().  For
       historical reasons these convert to the range 0..255 rather than
       0..1.

       There is also the pseudo-subclass Linear, which has the same API but
       does straight line transfer only, avoiding the if statement used to
       detect this in the LUT class functions.
