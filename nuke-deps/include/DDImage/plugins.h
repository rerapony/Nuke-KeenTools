    /*!
       Find and return the filename of a plugin.
       If the file is found, the full filename is copied to permanent
       storage and that permanent copy is returned.  If the file is
       not found zero is returned.

       If name contains any slashes, then it is expanded relative to the
       directory that is in plugin_name(), and that single filename
       (with any possible extensions) is checked. Note that only forward
       slashes work.

       Otherwise every single directory in getPluginPath() is looked into.

       \a extensions is an optional null-terminated list of filename
       extensions to try. These should start with a period. Each of them
       is added to the filename in each directory and the first match
       is returned. This is *only* done if name does not contain a period
       after the last slash. If you need to know which one was used, look
       at the end of the returned string (I don't return the index in order
       to force calling code to check extensions that are supplied in the
       plugin name).

       The extension ".osx.bundle" is handled specially, if it is matched
       a whole lot more data is tacked on in order to produce the actual
       name of the shared object file that the plugin really is in.

    /*!
       Try to load a shared-object or tcl plugin.

       plugin_find() is done with the passed name. This means that if the
       name does not have any slashes in it, it is looked for in every
       directory in getPluginPath(). If it does have a slash in it, it
       is tried in one location, relative the the location of the current
       plugin if it does not start with slash.

       If there is no period in the name after the last slash, then it
       tries the following extensions:
       - ".$plugin_ext" (".so", ".dylib", ".dll" etc depending
       on platform). This is a compiled plugin.
       These extensions allow plugins compiled for different platforms to
       coexist in the same directory.
       - ".tcl" and ".gizmo". Extensions for interpreted nuke scripts

       If the plugin is found, it is loaded. If the resulting filename ends
       in ".tcl" or ".gizmo" then plugin_interpret() is called. Otherwise
       plugin_binary() is called. The filename found is returned. If the
       plugin fails to load due to some error you can retrieve the error
       message with plugin_error().

       If no matching filename is found, null is returned. plugin_error()
       is set to an appropriate error message.

    /*!
       Load a plugin and make sure it defines some object (such as a
       script command). The function test(arg) should search for the
       desired object. \a arg is typically the name of the object.

       This calls test(arg) first and if it returns non-zero that is returned.

       It then tries plugin_load(name). If that fails null is returned.

       If the plugin does load, test(arg) is called again. If it returns
       non-zero it returns that value. This will happen if some constructor
       exectued by loading the plugin added the new object to the correct
       tables.

       If test(arg) fails after loading the plugin, plugin_error() is set
       to a message with the filename of the plugin saying the plugin did
       not define \a symbol. If \a symbol is null then \a name is used.

       Thus when this returns, either a pointer to the desired object is
       returned, or null is returned and a useful error message is in

        Normally the new directory is added to the \e start of the path,

        However if we are currently inside a plugin_load_all/one() call the
