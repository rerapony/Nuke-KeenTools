    /*! \class DD::Image::ShapeKnob

        This subclass of Knob can be used to manipulate a piece of data
        that changes over time, such as an animated shape. The Bezier
        operator uses this. There is also a demo Polygon plugin that you
        can refer to for an example of the use of this knob.

        You must write code to store a set of "key" shapes. You should
        also store a "current" shape that may be different from any of the
        keys. You also need to write methods to set the current shape to
        an interpolation between two shapes, and to add and delete keys
        and to set a key to the current shape.
