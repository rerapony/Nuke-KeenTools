    /// Class that wraps up version numbers and logic
    ///
    /// We have a hierarchy of three release numbers, these are...
    ///   - major - represents the product series, eg "5"
    ///   - minor - represents a specific release in the series, all
    ///             versions with the same minor number are compatible, eg "5.0"
    ///   - release - represents a specific release of a minor number typically
    ///             to fix bugs. eg "5.0.0"
    ///
    /// With this logic 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 are compatible versions that work the
    /// same way, but with 5.0.1 having bugs fixed and so on.
    ///
    /// To manage alpha/beta builds we also have a 'phase', which indicates
    /// whether the software is in development, alpha, beta or release. If the software
    /// is not in release, we have to have a fourth number indicating the
    /// alpha/beta number.
    ///
    /// The final number is the build number, which represents the current
    /// repository version.
    ///
    /// We also have logic to turn a version into and out of a string as
    /// well a comparison to see which release is greater than another.
    ///
    /// So,
    ///    - an alpha build will look like "5.0v3.000004a"
    ///    - an beta build will look like "5.0v3.000004b"
    ///    - a release build will look like "5.0v3"
    ///
    /// The string that represents the version number fits
    /// the following regex...
    /// (0..9)+"."(0..9)+"v"(0..9)+[(d|a|b|p)(0..9)+]
    ///
    /// NOTE: there is special case for version comparisons for dev builds.
    /// A dev build is considered not less than or greater than any other build for the same major and
    /// minor version, but not equal to either.  This is because dev versions can (in theory) proceed
    /// right through from v1a1 to full release of v99 and still not provide incompatibilities, and
    /// any incompatibility still wouldn't be detected by the current system of having dev builds at v0.
    /// e. g. 5.2v0d0 < 5.2v1 is false; 5.2v0d0 > 5.2v1 is false; 5.2v0d0 == 5.2v1 is false.
