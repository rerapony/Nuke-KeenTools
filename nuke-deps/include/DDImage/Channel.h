       Find or create a channel with this name. Plugins can call this to
       get the number for any channels they want to output.

       For instance if you output something called "shadow" for each pixel,
       you may want to call this with "shadow" as an argument in order to
       get what channel to write to. All calls to get "shadow" will return
       the same number. If you output an xyz triplet called "position" you
       may want to call this with "position.x", "position.y", and
       "position.z".

       Text before the last period is used to create or find the layer. If
       there is no period, it makes a layer called "other" (this may change
       in future versions). If \a sort is true, then the channel is
       insertion-sorted into the layer so that r,g,b,a are first and then
       the rest of the channels are in alphabetical order. If \a sort is
       false then the channel is appended to the end of the layer. (this
       sorting was needed because the exr library produces the channels in
       a random order due to the use of a hash table).
