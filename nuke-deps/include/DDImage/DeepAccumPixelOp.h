   * Helper class for Deep operators.  The DeepAccumPixelOp is intended
   * for operators that want to work on the accumlated deep samples rather than the individual samples like in DeepPixelOp.
   *
   * This is useful for operators such as a color correct which should not act on individual samples but rather act on the accumulated
   * result and then spread that result over the deep samples.
   *
   * processPixel gets passed the current accumulated sample with the accumulated color unpremultiplied
   *
   * the result of the operation should be put into output ( unpremultipied )
   *
   * The results of these operations will then be unaccumulated and put back into the deep samples.
   *
   * If the alpha was affected then all the deep samples will be reweighted by the new accumulated alpha
