    /*! \class DD::Image::Row

        Contains a read-write buffer of pixels representing
        a set of channels for a single horizontal line in an image. This
        is the standard method of passing image data around in DDImage.

        A Row acts like an array of 32 arrays of float pixel values, one
        for each possible channel. Each of these "buffers" can be indexed
        by X position. Only the locations greater or equal to a "left"
        position and less than a "right" position are legal, this range is
        set by the constructor or by the range() or offset() methods.
        (the stored pointer is offset from the allocated memory block
        by -left and the memory block is at least right-left long).

        The normal method of putting data into a Row is to call one of
        the get() functions. You can also call writable() to get a pointer
        to write to, or use erase() or copy().

        A great deal of code is dedicated to allowing the buffers to be
        shared between Row, Interest, caches, and local arrays, to avoid
        the expense of allocating them and especially of copying them.
        Each buffer may either be owned by the Row (in which case it is
        writable and it is deleted when the Row is destroyed), or it can
        be a read-only pointer to another piece of memory. Rows and other
        objects can copy the pointers from each other and can also transfer
        the "write" ownership of a buffer between them.

        Notice that getting your data into a Row and then looking at it
        is \e enormously faster than calling Iop::at(). You
        should do this if at all possible.

          The actual range will be the \e union of the range passed to the

          This is useful if Iop::engine() would like to write pixels outside the
          x,r range passed to it. Without this call, writing these pixels
          could crash because that memory may not be allocated.

          An example of such an Iop is file readers which need to decompress
          starting at pixel zero. It is far easier and faster to write the
          decompressor so it can store all the pixels as it calculates them,
          rather than having to test each to see if it is in range. So most
          such file readers call range(0,width) and then write the entire
          width.

          Because callers typically reuse rows for multiple requests, the
          reallocated buffers and larger size will likely be preserved for
          the next call. This means that much less memory allocation and
          freeing will be done than it looks like this does.
