        An Interest object creates a cache on the Iop and prevents
        any lines that are put into that cache from being deleted
        until the Interest is destroyed. This can be used by an
        engine() implementation to indicate that it will ask for
        the same data using Iop::at() or Iop::get() multiple times.

        The lines will probably stay around for some time after the
        interest is destroyed, so you can assume they are still there
        the next time the engine() is called.
