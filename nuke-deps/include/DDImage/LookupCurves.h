    /*! \class DD::Image::LookupCurves

       Provides user-editable lookup curves to a plugin.

       Your plugin must include an instance of this object, and must also call
       LookupCurves_knob() in the knobs() method. The user will then get a mini curve
       editor in the control panel where they can edit the lookup curves.

       This fairly opaque object replaces the array of "Animation" objects that were in
       the previous Nuke api. This was done to allow more freedom to reimplement the
       animation editor, and to allow lookup curves that can vary over time.

       Although many plugins call evaluate() directly in their engine()
       method, it is recommended that for maximum speed you should build your
       own indexed table during _validate() by calling evaluate() at that
       time to fill it in. For absolute maximum speed, use the append()
       method to check if the lookup curves have changed since you last
       filled in your table.  A plugin will always have a better idea about
       the domain, accuracy, and interpolation it needs, so Nuke does not
       bother even trying to provide an indexed table.
